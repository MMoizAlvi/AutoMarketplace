                Before starting AutoMarketplace, we operated a fleet company in New York City,
                registering over two million city miles. We learned many expensive lessons,
                but also developed automotive expertise.
              </p>
              <p className={css.paragraph}>
                From identifying trustable local auto repair providers to saving on parts to preventive maintenance,
                we managed to significantly reduce our operating costs (i.e., cost per mile).
                Experience and data helped inform more thoughtful maintenance spend.
              </p>
              <p className={css.subParagraph}>
                AutoMarketplace is born from our experience spending hundreds of
                thousands of dollars on auto repair & maintenance in New York City.

              <h3 className={css.heading}>Confirmed Pricing, No Surprises</h3>
              <p className={css.paragraph}>
                AutoMarketplace connects drivers to leading local mechanics, technicians and automotive vendors.
                Finding trustable auto repair & service providers with transparent pricing is difficult.
                Two out of three Americans donâ€™t trust auto repair shops*.
              </p>
              <p className={css.paragraph}>
                Our listings offer confirmed discounted pricing on common auto repair & services from trustable local shops.
                There are no vague estimates, dishonest upselling or surprises.
              </p>
              <h3 className={css.heading}>Warranty on All Work</h3>
              <p className={css.paragraph}>
                All vendors on the platform warranty their work, providing an additional layer of comfort.
                Warranty terms vary by the service provider, but are clearly described in each listing.
                We will also proactively help resolve any conflicts should they arise,
                but believe our screening processes and unique user-owned structure helps ensure only the top-rated businesses are on the platform.

                According to AAA, 64 million American drivers (one in three) are unable to pay for unexpected car repairs without going into debt.
                This is why we've integrated leading Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) provider Affirm as an option. In addition,
                we also have our own BNPL program for select users (click here to learn more).
